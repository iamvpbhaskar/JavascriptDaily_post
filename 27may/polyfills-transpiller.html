<!-- Polyfills :

This is code snippets or libraries that provide modern functionality in older browsers that don't natively support it.
 For example, if a newer JavaScript method or API is not supported in older versions of Internet Explorer,
a polyfill can be used to replicate that functionality using older, more widely supported methods. 
Polyfills essentially "fill in" the gaps left by browser vendors. -->

<!-- For example, Math.trunc(n) is a function that “cuts off” the decimal part of a number, e.g Math.trunc(1.23) returns 1. -->

<!-- In some (very outdated) JavaScript engines, there’s no Math.trunc, so such code will fail. -->

<!-- A script that updates/adds new functions is called “polyfill”.
 It “fills in” the gap and adds missing implementations.

 the polyfill for Math.trunc is a script that implements it, like this: -->

 <script>
    if (!Math.trunc) { // if no such function
  // implement it
  Math.trunc = function(number) {
    // Math.ceil and Math.floor exist even in ancient JavaScript engines
    // they are covered later in the tutorial
    return number < 0 ? Math.ceil(number) : Math.floor(number);
  };
}
 </script>

<!-- JavaScript is a highly dynamic language. Scripts may add/modify any function, even built-in ones.

Two interesting polyfill libraries are:

core js that supports a lot, allows to include only needed features.
polyfill.io service that provides a script with polyfills, depending on the features and user’s browser. -->

<!-- ********************************************************** -->

<!-- Transpilers:
These are tools that convert source code written in one programming language to another.
 In the context of web development, the most common use of transpilers is to convert newer versions of JavaScript (ES6/ES7)
  into older versions (ES5) that are compatible with a wider range of browsers. This process is often referred to as "transpiling" 
  because the code is transformed rather than simply being translated.



  The most popular JavaScript transpiler is Babel, 
  which allows developers to write code using the latest language features while still ensuring compatibility with older browsers. -->
<!-- 
E.g. JavaScript before year 2020 didn’t have the “nullish coalescing operator” ??.
 So, if a visitor uses an outdated browser, 
 it may fail to understand the code like height = height ?? 100. -->

<!-- A transpiler would analyze our code and rewrite height ?? 100 into (height !== undefined && height !== null) ? height : 100 -->

<script>
    // before running the transpiler
height = height ?? 100;

// after running the transpiler
height = (height !== undefined && height !== null) ? height : 100;
</script>

<!-- Now the rewritten code is suitable for older JavaScript engines.

Usually, a developer runs the transpiler on their own computer, and then deploys the transpiled code to the server.

Speaking of names, Babel is one of the most prominent transpilers out there.

Modern project build systems, such as webpack, provide a means to run a transpiler automatically on every code change, so it’s very easy to integrate into the development process. -->


<!-- Summary -->
<!-- polyfills: 
  that enable developers to use modern JavaScript features in older browsers by providing fallback functionality,while
 transpilers:
 allow developers to write code using the latest language features and then convert it into a form that is compatible with older browsers. 
  
 Both polyfills and transpilers are essential tools for web developers who need to support a wide range of browsers -->
