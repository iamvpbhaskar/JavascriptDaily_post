    <!-- Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors within a script.
        It also allows to trace the code step by step to see what exactly is going on. -->


        <!-- Console -->
    <!-- If we press Esc, then a console opens below. We can type commands there and press Enter to execute.
    After a statement is executed, its result is shown below.
    For example, here 1+2 results in 3, while the function call hello("debugger") returns nothing, so the result is undefined: -->
            1+2
            3
            hello("debugger");
            undefined
   <!--********************************* -->

        <!-- Breakpoints -->
<!-- 
        A breakpoint is a point of code where the debugger will automatically pause the JavaScript execution.
        While the code is paused, we can examine current variables, execute commands in the console etc. In other words, 
        we can debug it. -->

         <!-- Right click on the line number allows to create a conditional breakpoint. It only triggers when the given expression, 
    that you should provide when you create it, is truthy. -->
   <!--********************************* -->

        <!-- The command “debugger” -->

    <script>
        function hello(name) {
        let phrase = `Hello, ${name}!`;
        debugger;  // <-- the debugger stops here
        say(phrase);
        }
    </script>
    <!-- Such command works only when the development tools are open, otherwise the browser ignores it. -->
   <!--********************************* -->

    <!-- Pause and look around -->
    
    <!-- In our example, hello() is called during the page load, so the easiest way to activate the debugger 
        (after we’ve set the breakpoints) is to reload the page. So let’s press F5 (Windows, -->

        <!-- As the breakpoint is set, the execution pauses at the 4th line: -->
      
        <!-- 
            function hello (name) { name = "John" 
            let phrase = `Hello, ${name}!`;          phrase = "Hello, John!"

        ->4th line ->  say (phrase); breakpoint here pauses
            }

        function say (phrase) {
             alert(** ${phrase} **`);
            }    
        -->

        <!-- Watch – shows current values for any expressions.
        You can click the plus + and input an expression. The debugger will show its value, automatically recalculating it in the process of execution.

        Call Stack :– shows the nested calls chain. At the current moment the debugger is inside hello() call, 
        called by a script in index.html (no function there, so it’s called “anonymous”).
        If you click on a stack item (e.g. “anonymous”), the debugger jumps to the corresponding code, 
        and all its variables can be examined as well.

        Scope: – current variables.
        Local shows local function variables. You can also see their values highlighted right over the source.
        Global has global variables (out of any functions).

   <!-- Logging -->
   <!-- To output something to console from our code, there’s console.log function. -->
   
   <!-- For instance, this outputs values from 0 to 4 to console: -->
   <script>
        // open console to see
        for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        console.log("value,", i);
         }
   </script>
   <!-- to see the log code have to open console using CTRL + shift + i to open console  -->
