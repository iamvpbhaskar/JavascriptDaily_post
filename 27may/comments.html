    <!-- As we all know comments how it works what is it ??? -->

    <!-- Bad comments -->

    <script>
      // This code will do this thing (...) and that thing (...)
      // ...and who knows what else...
      very;
      complex;
      code;
    </script>
    <!-- But in good code, the amount of such “explanatory” comments should be
         minimal. Seriously, the code should be easy to understand without them.
     -->
    <!-- if the code is so unclear that it requires a comment, 
        then maybe it should be rewritten instead -->

    <!-- Recipe: factor out functions
Sometimes it’s beneficial to replace a code piece with a function, like here: -->
    <!-- function showPrimes(n) {
   nextPrime:
   for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) 
     // check if i is a prime number
     for (let j = 2; j < i; j++) {
       if (i % j == 0) continue nextPrime;
     
     alert(i);
   }
 } -->

    <!-- The better variant, with a factored out function isPrime: -->
    <script>
      function showPrimes(n) {
        for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
          if (!isPrime(i)) continue;

          alert(i);
        }
      }

      function isPrime(n) {
        for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
          if (n % i == 0) return false;
        }

        return true;
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
<!-- Now we can understand the code easily. The function itself becomes the comment.
 Such code is called self-descriptive. -->

<!-- Recipe: create functions
And if we have a long “code sheet” like this: -->

<!-- // here we add whiskey
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  let drop = getWhiskey();
  smell(drop);
  add(drop, glass);
}

// here we add juice
for(let t = 0; t < 3; t++) {
  let tomato = getTomato();
  examine(tomato);
  let juice = press(tomato);
  add(juice, glass);
}

// ... -->

<!-- better variant to refactor it into functions like: -->

<script>
  addWhiskey(glass);
  addJuice(glass);

  function addWhiskey(container) {
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      let drop = getWhiskey();
      //...
    }
  }

  function addJuice(container) {
    for (let t = 0; t < 3; t++) {
      let tomato = getTomato();
      //...
    }
  }
</script>

<!-- Once again, functions themselves tell what’s going on. There’s nothing to comment. And also the code structure is better when split.
 It’s clear what every function does, what it takes and what it returns. -->

 <!-- Good comments
So, explanatory comments are usually bad. Which comments are good? -->

<!-- Describe the architecture
Provide a high-level overview of components, how they interact, what’s the control flow in various situations… In short – the bird’s eye view of the code. There’s a special language UML to build high-level architecture diagrams explaining the code. Definitely worth studying.
Document function parameters and usage -->

<!-- There’s a special syntax JSDoc to document a function: usage, parameters, returned value. -->

<!-- /**
 * Returns x raised to the n-th power.
 *
 * @param {number} x The number to raise.
 * @param {number} n The power, must be a natural number.
 * @return {number} x raised to the n-th power.
 */
function pow(x, n) {
  ...
} 

 Such comments allow us to understand the purpose of the function 
and use it the right way without looking in its code -->

<!-- Comments that explain the solution are very important. They help to continue development the right way.

Any subtle features of the code? Where they are used?
If the code has anything subtle and counter-intuitive, it’s definitely worth commenting. -->


<!-- Good comments allow us to maintain the code well, come back to it after a delay and use it more effectively. -->

<!-- Comment this: -->
<!-- Overall architecture, high-level view.
Function usage.
Important solutions, especially when not immediately obvious. -->

<!-- Avoid comments: -->
<!-- That tell “how code works” and “what it does”.
Put them in only if it’s impossible to make the code so simple and self-descriptive that it doesn’t require them.-->

<!--Comments are also used for auto-documenting tools like JSDoc3: they read them and generate HTML-docs (or docs in another format). -->
