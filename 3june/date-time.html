<!-- Date and time
Let’s meet a new built-in object: Date. It stores the date, time and provides methods for date/time management.

For instance, we can use it to store creation/modification times, to measure time, or just to print out the current date.

Creation
To create a new Date object call new Date() with one of the following arguments: -->

new Date()
Without arguments – create a Date object for the current date and time:

let now = new Date();
alert( now ); // shows current date/time
new Date(milliseconds)
Create a Date object with the time equal to number of milliseconds (1/1000 of a second) passed after the Jan 1st of 1970 UTC+0.

// 0 means 01.01.1970 UTC+0
let Jan01_1970 = new Date(0);
alert( Jan01_1970 );

// now add 24 hours, get 02.01.1970 UTC+0
let Jan02_1970 = new Date(24 * 3600 * 1000);
alert( Jan02_1970 );
An integer number representing the number of milliseconds that has passed since the beginning of 1970 is called a timestamp.
