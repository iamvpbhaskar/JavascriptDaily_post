        // Variables
        // We can declare variables to store data by using the var, let, or const keywords.

        // let – is a modern variable declaration.
        // var – is an old-school variable declaration. Normally we don’t use it at all, but we’ll cover subtle differences from let in the chapter The old "var", just in case you need them.
        // const – is like let, but the value of the variable can’t be changed.

        // Tasks
        // Declare two variables: admin and name.
        // Assign the value "John" to name.
        // Copy the value from name to admin.
        // Show the value of admin using alert (must output “John”).

        // output
        let admin; // can declare two variables at once

        let name = "John";

        admin = name;

        alert( admin ); // "John"


        // Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?
        // Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. How would you name that variable?


        // Uppercase const?
        // Examine the following code:

        const birthday = '18.04.1982';

        const age = someCode(birthday);

        const BIRTHDAY = '18.04.1982'; // make birthday uppercase?

        const AGE = someCode(BIRTHDAY); // make age uppercase?
        // use upper case for constants that are “hard-coded” birthday is exactly like that.   age is evaluated in run-time
