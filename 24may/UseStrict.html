<!-- “use strict”
The directive looks like a string: "use strict" or 'use strict'. When it is located at the top of a script, the whole script works the “modern” way.

For example:

"use strict";

// this code works the modern way
... -->

<!-- Please make sure that "use strict" is at the top of your scripts, otherwise strict mode may not be enabled. -->
<!-- alert("some code");
// "use strict" below is ignored--it must be at the top

"use strict";

// strict mode is not activated -->
<!-- 
Browser console
When you use a developer console to run code, please note that it doesn’t use strict by default.

Sometimes, when use strict makes a difference, you’ll get incorrect results. -->

<!-- Should we “use strict”? -->

<!-- One could recommend to start scripts with "use strict"… But you know what’s cool? -->

<!-- Modern JavaScript supports “classes” and “modules” – advanced language structures (we’ll surely get to them), that enable use strict automatically. So we don’t need to add the "use strict" directive, if we use them. -->

<!-- So, for now "use strict"; is a welcome guest at the top of your scripts. Later, when your code is all in classes and modules, you may omit it. -->

<!-- As of now, we’ve got to know about use strict in general. -->

<!-- The "use strict" directive enables JavaScript's strict mode. JavaScript's strict mode was introduced in ECMAScript 5.
It enforces stricter parsing and error handling on the code at runtime. It also helps you write cleaner code and catch errors and bugs that
 might otherwise go unnoticed. -->
