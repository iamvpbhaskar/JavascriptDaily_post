    <!-- Arrow function creates a function func that accepts arguments arg1......argN,
     then evaluates the expression on the right side with their use and returns its result. -->

    <!-- shorter version of : -->
    <script>
      let func = function (arg1, arg2, argN) {
        return expression;
      };
    </script>

    <script>
      let sum = (a, b) => a + b;

      /* This arrow function is a shorter form of:

let sum = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
*/

      alert(sum(1, 2)); // 3
    </script>

    <!-- As you can see, (a, b) => a + b means a function that accepts two arguments named a and b.
     Upon the execution, it evaluates the expression a + b and returns the result. -->

    <!-- If we have only one argument, then parentheses around parameters can be omitted, making that even shorter. -->

    <!-- For example: -->
    <script>
      let double = (n) => n * 2;
      // roughly the same as: let double = function(n) { return n * 2 }
      alert(double(3)); // 6
    </script>

    <!-- If there are no arguments, parentheses are empty, but they must be present: -->
    <script>
      let sayHi = () => alert("Hello!");
      sayHi();
    </script>
    <!-- Arrow functions can be used in the same way as Function Expressions.
        For instance, to dynamically create a function: -->
    <script>
      let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

      let welcome =
        age < 18 ? () => alert("Hello!") : () => alert("Greetings!");

      welcome();
    </script>

    <!-- Arrow functions may appear unfamiliar and not very readable at first, but 
                that quickly changes as the eyes get used to the structure. -->

    <!-- Multiline arrow functions
The arrow functions that we’ve seen so far were very simple.
 They took arguments from the left of =>, evaluated and returned the right-side expression with them. -->

    <!-- Sometimes we need a more complex function, with multiple expressions and statements.
     In that case, we can enclose them in curly braces. The major difference is that curly braces require a
      return within them to return a value (just like a regular function does). -->

    <script>
      let sum1 = (a, b) => {
        // the curly brace opens a multiline function
        let result = a + b;
        return result; // if we use curly braces, then we need an explicit "return"
      };

      alert(sum1(1, 2)); // 3
    </script>

    <!-- Arrow functions are handy for simple actions, especially for one-liners. They come in two flavors:

Without curly braces: (...args) => expression – the right side is an expression: the function evaluates it and returns the result. Parentheses can be omitted, if there’s only a single argument, e.g. n => n*2.
With curly braces: (...args) => { body } – brackets allow us to write multiple statements inside the function, but we need an explicit return to return something. -->

    <!-- 
Rewrite with arrow functions
Replace Function Expressions with arrow functions -->

    <!-- <script>
    function ask(question, yes, no) {
  if (confirm(question)) yes();
  else no();
}

ask(
  "Do you agree?",
  function() { alert("You agreed."); },
  function() { alert("You canceled the execution."); }
);
</script> -->

    <script>
      function ask(question, yes, no) {
        if (confirm(question)) yes();
        else no();
      }

      ask(
        "Do you agree?",
        () => alert("You agreed."),
        () => alert("You canceled the execution.")
      );
    </script>
  </body>
