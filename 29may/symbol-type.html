<!-- Symbol type
By specification, only two primitive types may serve as object property keys:

string type, or
symbol type.
Otherwise, if one uses another type, such as number, it’s autoconverted to string. So that obj[1] is the same as obj["1"], and obj[true] is the same as obj["true"].

Until now we’ve been using only strings.

Now let’s explore symbols, see what they can do for us.

Symbols
A “symbol” represents a unique identifier.

A value of this type can be created using Symbol(): -->
<script>
let id8= Symbol();
// Upon creation, we can give symbols a description (also called a symbol name), mostly useful for debugging purposes:

// id is a symbol with the description "id"
let id1 = Symbol("id");
// Symbols are guaranteed to be unique. Even if we create many symbols with exactly the same description, they are different values. The description is just a label that doesn’t affect anything.

// For instance, here are two symbols with the same description – they are not equal:

let id2 = Symbol("id");
let id3 = Symbol("id");

alert(id1 == id2); // false
</script>

<!-- Symbols don’t auto-convert to a string
Most values in JavaScript support implicit conversion to a string. For instance, we can alert almost any value, and it will work. Symbols are special. They don’t auto-convert.

For instance, this alert will show an error: -->

<script>
let id12 = Symbol("id");
alert(id12); // TypeError: Cannot convert a Symbol value to a string
</script>

<!-- That’s a “language guard” against messing up, because strings and symbols are fundamentally different and should not accidentally convert one into another.
If we really want to show a symbol, we need to explicitly call .toString() on it, like here: -->

<script>
    let id11 = Symbol("id");
alert(id11.toString()); // Symbol(id), now it works
// Or get symbol.description property to show the description only:

let id = Symbol("id");
alert(id.description); // id
</script>

<!-- “Hidden” properties
Symbols allow us to create “hidden” properties of an object, that no other part of code can accidentally access or overwrite.

For instance, if we’re working with user objects, that belong to a third-party code. We’d like to add identifiers to them.

Let’s use a symbol key for it: -->

<script>
    let user5 = { // belongs to another code
  name: "John"
};

let id10 = Symbol("id");

user[id10] = 1;

alert( user[id10] ); // we can access the data using the symbol as the key
</script>


<!-- 
What’s the benefit of using Symbol("id") over a string "id"?

As user objects belong to another codebase, it’s unsafe to add fields to them, since we might affect pre-defined behavior in that other codebase. However, symbols cannot be accessed accidentally. 
The third-party code won’t be aware of newly defined symbols, so it’s safe to add symbols to the user objects.
script can create its own Symbol("id"), like this: -->

// ...
<script>
    let id9 = Symbol("id");

user[id9] = "Their id value";
</script>
<!-- There will be no conflict between our and their identifiers, because symbols are always different, even if they have the same name.

…But if we used a string "id" instead of a symbol for the same purpose, then there would be a conflict: -->

<script>
    let user4 = { name: "John" };

// Our script uses "id" property
user.id8 = "Our id value";

// ...Another script also wants "id" for its purposes...

user.id8 = "Their id value"
// Boom! overwritten by another script!

</script>


<!-- Symbols in an object literal
If we want to use a symbol in an object literal {...}, we need square brackets around it.

Like this: -->
<script>
    
let id7= Symbol("id");

let user3 = {
  name: "John",
  [id7]: 123 // not "id": 123
};
</script>
<!-- That’s because we need the value from the variable id as the key, not the string “id”.

Symbols are skipped by for…in
Symbolic properties do not participate in for..in loop.

For instance: -->

<script>
    let id6 = Symbol("id");
let user2 = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  [id6]: 123
};

for (let key in user) alert(key); // name, age (no symbols)

// the direct access by the symbol works
alert( "Direct: " + user[id] ); // Direct: 123
</script>
<!-- Object.keys(user) also ignores them. That’s a part of the general “hiding symbolic properties” principle. If another script or a library loops over our object, it won’t unexpectedly access a symbolic property.

In contrast, Object.assign copies both string and symbol properties: -->
<script>
let id5 = Symbol("id");
let user = {
  [id5]: 123
};

let clone = Object.assign({}, user);

alert( clone[id5] ); // 123
</script>

<!-- There’s no paradox here. That’s by design. The idea is that when we clone an object or merge objects, we usually want all properties to be copied (including symbols like id).

Global symbols
As we’ve seen, usually all symbols are different, even if they have the same name. But sometimes we want same-named symbols to be same entities. For instance, different parts of our application want to access symbol "id" meaning exactly the same property.

To achieve that, there exists a global symbol registry. We can create symbols in it and access them later, and it guarantees that repeated accesses by the same name return exactly the same symbol.

In order to read (create if absent) a symbol from the registry, use Symbol.for(key).

That call checks the global registry, and if there’s a symbol described as key, then returns it, otherwise creates a new symbol Symbol(key) and stores it in the registry by the given key.

For instance: -->
<script>
// read from the global registry
let id4 = Symbol.for("id"); // if the symbol did not exist, it is created

// read it again (maybe from another part of the code)
let idAgain = Symbol.for("id");

// the same symbol
alert( id4 === idAgain ); // true
</script>

<!-- Symbols inside the registry are called global symbols. If we want an application-wide symbol, accessible everywhere in the code – that’s what they are for. -->
