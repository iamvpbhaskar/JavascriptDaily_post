<!-- Methods of primitives
JavaScript allows us to work with primitives (strings, numbers, etc.) as if they were objects. They also provide methods to call as such. We will study those soon, but first we’ll see how it works because, of course, primitives are not objects (and here we will make it even clearer).

Let’s look at the key distinctions between primitives and objects.

A primitive

Is a value of a primitive type.
There are 7 primitive types: string, number, bigint, boolean, symbol, null and undefined. -->

<!-- An object
Is capable of storing multiple values as properties.
Can be created with {}, for instance: {name: "John", age: 30}. There are other kinds of objects in JavaScript: functions, for example, are objects.
One of the best things about objects is that we can store a function as one of its properties. -->
<script>
let john = {
  name: "John",
  sayHi: function() {
    alert("Hi buddy!");
  }
};

john.sayHi(); // Hi buddy!
// So here we’ve made an object john with the method sayHi.
</script>

<!-- 
A primitive as an object
Here’s the paradox faced by the creator of JavaScript:

There are many things one would want to do with a primitive, like a string or a number. It would be great to access them using methods.
Primitives must be as fast and lightweight as possible.
The solution looks a little bit awkward, but here it is:

Primitives are still primitive. A single value, as desired.
The language allows access to methods and properties of strings, numbers, booleans and symbols.
In order for that to work, a special “object wrapper” that provides the extra functionality is created, and then is destroyed.
The “object wrappers” are different for each primitive type and are called: String, Number, Boolean, Symbol and BigInt. Thus, they provide different sets of methods.

For instance, there exists a string method str.toUpperCase() that returns a capitalized str.

Here’s how it works: -->
<script>
let str = "Hello";

alert( str.toUpperCase() ); // HELLO
// Simple, right? Here’s what actually happens in str.toUpperCase():

</script>

<!-- The string str is a primitive. So in the moment of accessing its property, a special object is created that knows the value of the string, and has useful methods, like toUpperCase().
That method runs and returns a new string (shown by alert).
The special object is destroyed, leaving the primitive str alone.
So primitives can provide methods, but they still remain lightweight.



A number has methods of its own, for instance, toFixed(n) rounds the number to the given precision: -->
<script>
let n = 1.23456;

alert( n.toFixed(2) ); // 1.23

</script>



<!-- Constructors String/Number/Boolean are for internal use only
For instance: -->

<script>
    alert( typeof 0 ); // "number"

alert( typeof new Number(0) ); // "object"!
// Objects are always truthy in if, so here the alert will show up:

let zero = new Number(0);

if (zero) { // zero is true, because it's an object
  alert( "zero is truthy!?!" );
}

</script>


<!-- The special primitives null and undefined are exceptions.
 They have no corresponding “wrapper objects” and provide no methods. In a sense, they are “the most primitive”.

An attempt to access a property of such value would give the error: -->
<script>
alert(null.test); // error
</script>




<!-- Primitives except null and undefined provide many helpful methods.
     We will study those in the upcoming chapters.
Formally, these methods work via temporary objects, 
but JavaScript engines are well tuned to optimize that internally, so they are not expensive to call. -->


<!-- Tasks -->

<!-- Can I add a string property?
importance: 5
Consider the following code: -->
<script>
let str1 = "Hello";

str1.test = 5;

alert(str1.test);

</script>

<!-- What do you think, will it work? What will be shown? -->
<script>
let str2 = "Hello";

str2.test = 5; // (*)

alert(str2.test);
</script>

<!-- Depending on whether you have use strict or not, the result may be:

undefined (no strict mode)
An error (strict mode).
Why? Let’s replay what’s happening at line (*):

When a property of str is accessed, a “wrapper object” is created.
In strict mode, writing into it is an error.
Otherwise, the operation with the property is carried on, the object gets the test property, but after that the “wrapper object” disappears, so in the last line str has no trace of the property.
This example clearly shows that primitives are not objects.

They can’t store additional data. -->
