<!-- Garbage collection
Memory management in JavaScript is performed automatically and invisibly to us. We create primitives, objects, functions… All that takes memory.-->

<!-- How Garbage Collection Works
Memory Allocation:

When objects, arrays, or other data structures are created, memory is allocated for them on the heap.
Memory Usage:

As the program runs, it uses and manipulates these data structures. Some of them may no longer be needed after certain operations.
Garbage Collection: -->

<!-- The garbage collector identifies memory that is no longer reachable or needed by the program and reclaims it.
     This reclaimed memory can then be used for new allocations. -->

<!-- Garbage Collection Algorithms
JavaScript engines use different algorithms for garbage collection. The most common ones are:

Mark-and-Sweep:

Marking Phase: The garbage collector starts from the roots and traverses all reachable objects, marking them as "live".
Sweeping Phase: It then scans the memory, collecting objects that are not marked and reclaiming their memory.
Reference Counting:

Each object has a count of references to it. When the reference count drops to zero, the object can be collected.
Drawback: This method can fail in cases of circular references (objects that reference each other but are no longer reachable from the roots).
Modern Garbage Collection Techniques
Modern JavaScript engines, such as V8 (used in Chrome and Node.js), use more sophisticated techniques:

Generational Garbage Collection:
Memory is divided into different "generations" based on the lifespan of objects.
Young Generation: Contains objects that have been recently created. These are collected frequently.
Old Generation: Contains objects that have survived multiple garbage collection cycles. These are collected less frequently.
Incremental and Concurrent Collection:
Incremental Collection: The garbage collector breaks its work into smaller chunks, interleaving with the application execution to reduce pause times.
Concurrent Collection: The garbage collector runs in parallel with the application, further minimizing pauses. -->


<!-- Example -->

<script>
function createObjects() {
    let obj1 = { name: 'object1' };
    let obj2 = { name: 'object2' };

    obj1.reference = obj2; // obj1 references obj2
    obj2.reference = obj1; // obj2 references obj1

    // obj1 and obj2 are reachable from the root (local scope)
    return obj1;
}

let globalObj = createObjects();

// After createObjects() execution, obj1 and obj2 are still reachable through globalObj
// When globalObj is set to null, obj1 and obj2 may become garbage collected

globalObj = null;
</script>
// Now, obj1 and obj2 are not reachable, making them eligible for garbage collection

<!-- 
Reachability
The main concept of memory management in JavaScript is reachability.

Simply put, “reachable” values are those that are accessible or usable somehow. They are guaranteed to be stored in memory.

There’s a background process in the JavaScript engine that is called garbage collector. It monitors all objects and removes those that have become unreachable. -->

<!-- Here’s the simplest example:  -->
<script>
// user has a reference to the object
let user = {
  name: "John"
};
</script>

<!-- The global variable "user" references the object {name: "John"} (we’ll call it John for brevity). The "name" property of John stores a primitive, so it’s painted inside the object.

If the value of user is overwritten, the reference is lost: -->
<script>
user = null;
</script>

<!-- Now John becomes unreachable. 
    There’s no way to access it, no references to it. 
    Garbage collector will junk the data and free the memory. -->



<!-- Now if we do the same: -->
<script>
    user = null;
</script>
<!-- …Then the object is still reachable via admin global variable, so it must stay in memory. 
If we overwrite admin too, then it can be removed. -->



<!-- Now a more complex example. The family: -->
<script>
function marry(man, woman) {
  woman.husband = man;
  man.wife = woman;

  return {
    father: man,
    mother: woman
  }
}

let family = marry({
  name: "John"
}, {
  name: "Ann"
});
</script>

<!-- Function marry “marries” two objects by giving them references to each other and returns a new object that contains them both. -->


<!-- 
As of now, all objects are reachable.

Now let’s remove two references: -->
<script>
delete family.father;
delete family.mother.husband;
</script>


<!-- Outgoing references do not matter. Only incoming ones can make an object reachable. So, John is now unreachable and will be removed from the memory with all its data that also became unaccessible.

After garbage collection: 

Unreachable island
It is possible that the whole island of interlinked objects becomes unreachable and is removed from the memory.

The source object is the same as above. Then: -->
<script>
family = null;
</script>

<!-- It’s obvious that John and Ann are still linked, both have incoming references. But that’s not enough.

The former "family" object has been unlinked from the root, there’s no reference to it any more, so the whole island becomes unreachable and will be removed. -->



<!-- Internal algorithms
The basic garbage collection algorithm is called “mark-and-sweep”.

The following “garbage collection” steps are regularly performed:

The garbage collector takes roots and “marks” (remembers) them.
Then it visits and “marks” all references from them.
Then it visits marked objects and marks their references. All visited objects are remembered, so as not to visit the same object twice in the future.
…And so on until every reachable (from the roots) references are visited.
All objects except marked ones are removed. -->




<!-- 
Summary
The main things to know:

Garbage collection is performed automatically. We cannot force or prevent it.
Objects are retained in memory while they are reachable.
Being referenced is not the same as being reachable (from a root): a pack of interlinked objects can become unreachable as a whole, as we’ve seen in the example above. -->
