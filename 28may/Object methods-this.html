    <title>Objects - this method</title>
</head>
<body>
    
    <!-- Object methods, "this" -->

<!-- Objects are usually created to represent entities of the real world, like users, orders and so on: -->
<script>
    let user1 = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30
    };
    </script>
    
    <!-- And, in the real world, a user can act: select something from the shopping cart, login, logout etc.
    
    Actions are represented in JavaScript by functions in properties.
    
    Method examples
    For a start, let’s teach the user to say hello: -->
    
    <script>
        let user2 = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30
    };
    user2.sayHi = function() {
      alert("Hello!");
    };
    user2.sayHi(); // Hello!
    </script>
    
    
    <!-- Here we’ve just used a Function Expression to create a function and assign it to the property user.sayHi of the object. -->
    <!-- Then we can call it as user.sayHi(). The user can now speak!
    
    A function that is a property of an object is called its method.
    
    So, here we’ve got a method sayHi of the object user. -->
    
    <!-- Object-oriented programming
    When we write our code using objects to represent entities, that’s called object-oriented programming, in short: “OOP”. -->
    
    Method shorthand
    There exists a shorter syntax for methods in an object literal:
    <script>
    // these objects do the same
    
    user3 = {
      sayHi: function() {
        alert("Hello");
      }
    };
    
    // method shorthand looks better, right?
    user3 = {
      sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function(){...}"
        alert("Hello");
      }
    };
    </script>
    <!-- As demonstrated, we can omit "function" and just write sayHi(). -->
    
    <!-- this” in methods
    It’s common that an object method needs to access the information stored in the object to do its job.
    
    For instance, the code inside user.sayHi() may need the name of the user.
    
    
    
    To access the object, a method can use the this keyword. -->
    <script>
    let user4 = {
        name: "John",
        age: 30,
      
        sayHi() {
          // "this" is the "current object"
          alert(this.name);
        }
      
      };
      
      user4.sayHi(); // John
    //   Here during the execution of user.sayHi(), the value of this will be user.
    </script>
    
    <!-- “this” is not bound
    In JavaScript, keyword this behaves unlike most other programming languages. It can be used in any function, even if it’s not a method of an object.
    
    There’s no syntax error in the following example: -->
    <script>
    function sayHi() {
      alert( this.name );
    }
    // The value of this is evaluated during the run-time, depending on the context.
    </script>
    
    <!-- Calling without an object: this == undefined
    We can even call the function without an object at all: -->
    <script>
    function sayHi() {
      alert(this);
    }
    
    sayHi(); // undefined
    // In this case this is undefined in strict mode. If we try to access this.name, there will be an error.
    </script>
    
    <!-- In non-strict mode the value of this in such case will be the global object (window in a browser, 
    we’ll get to it later in the chapter Global object). This is a historical behavior that "use strict" fixes.
    
    Usually such call is a programming error. If there’s this inside a function, it expects to be called in an object context. -->
    
    
    
    <!-- Arrow functions have no “this”
    Arrow functions are special: they don’t have their “own” this. If we reference this from such a function, it’s taken from the outer “normal” function.
    
    For instance, here arrow() uses this from the outer user.sayHi() method: -->
    <script>
    let user7 = {
      firstName: "Ilya",
      sayHi() {
        let arrow = () => alert(this.firstName);
        arrow();
      }
    };
    
    user7.sayHi(); // Ilya
    </script>
    
    <!-- That’s a special feature of arrow functions,
         it’s useful when we actually do not want to have a separate this, 
         but rather to take it from the outer context. Later in the chapter Arrow functions revisited we’ll go more deeply into arrow functions. -->
