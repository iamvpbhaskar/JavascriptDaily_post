    <!-- Object methods, "this" -->

<!-- Objects are usually created to represent entities of the real world, like users, orders and so on: -->
<script>
    let user1 = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30
    };
    </script>
    
    <!-- And, in the real world, a user can act: select something from the shopping cart, login, logout etc.
    
    Actions are represented in JavaScript by functions in properties.
    
    Method examples
    For a start, let’s teach the user to say hello: -->
    
    <script>
        let user2 = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30
    };
    user2.sayHi = function() {
      alert("Hello!");
    };
    user2.sayHi(); // Hello!
    </script>
    
    
    <!-- Here we’ve just used a Function Expression to create a function and assign it to the property user.sayHi of the object. -->
    <!-- Then we can call it as user.sayHi(). The user can now speak!
    
    A function that is a property of an object is called its method.
    
    So, here we’ve got a method sayHi of the object user. -->
    
    <!-- Object-oriented programming
    When we write our code using objects to represent entities, that’s called object-oriented programming, in short: “OOP”. -->
    
    <!-- Method shorthand
    There exists a shorter syntax for methods in an object literal: -->
    <script>
    // these objects do the same
    
    user3 = {
      sayHi: function() {
        alert("Hello");
      }
    };
    
    // method shorthand looks better, right?
    user3 = {
      sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function(){...}"
        alert("Hello");
      }
    };
    </script>
    <!-- As demonstrated, we can omit "function" and just write sayHi(). -->
    
    <!-- this” in methods
    It’s common that an object method needs to access the information stored in the object to do its job.
    
    For instance, the code inside user.sayHi() may need the name of the user.
    
    
    
    To access the object, a method can use the this keyword. -->
    <script>
    let user4 = {
        name: "John",
        age: 30,
      
        sayHi() {
          // "this" is the "current object"
          alert(this.name);
        }
      
      };
      
      user4.sayHi(); // John
    //   Here during the execution of user.sayHi(), the value of this will be user.
    </script>
    
    <!-- “this” is not bound
    In JavaScript, keyword this behaves unlike most other programming languages. It can be used in any function, even if it’s not a method of an object.
    
    There’s no syntax error in the following example: -->
    <script>
    function sayHi() {
      alert( this.name );
    }
    // The value of this is evaluated during the run-time, depending on the context.
    </script>
    
    <!-- Calling without an object: this == undefined
    We can even call the function without an object at all: -->
    <script>
    function sayHi() {
      alert(this);
    }
    
    sayHi(); // undefined
    // In this case this is undefined in strict mode. If we try to access this.name, there will be an error.
    </script>
    
    <!-- In non-strict mode the value of this in such case will be the global object (window in a browser, 
    we’ll get to it later in the chapter Global object). This is a historical behavior that "use strict" fixes.
    
    Usually such call is a programming error. If there’s this inside a function, it expects to be called in an object context. -->
    
    
    
    <!-- Arrow functions have no “this”
    Arrow functions are special: they don’t have their “own” this. If we reference this from such a function, it’s taken from the outer “normal” function.
    
    For instance, here arrow() uses this from the outer user.sayHi() method: -->
    <script>
    let user7 = {
      firstName: "Ilya",
      sayHi() {
        let arrow = () => alert(this.firstName);
        arrow();
      }
    };
    
    user7.sayHi(); // Ilya
    </script>
    
    <!-- That’s a special feature of arrow functions,
         it’s useful when we actually do not want to have a separate this, 
         but rather to take it from the outer context. Later in the chapter Arrow functions revisited we’ll go more deeply into arrow functions. -->



         <!-- Tasks -->
<!-- Using "this" in object literal -->
 <!-- Here the function makeUser returns an object. -->

<!-- What is the result of accessing its ref? Why? -->
<!-- <script>
function makeUser() {
  return {
    name: "John",
    ref: this
  };
}

let user8 = makeUser();

alert( user8.ref.name ); // What's the result? 
</script> -->

<!-- Answer: an error.

Try it: -->
<script>
function makeUser() {
  return {
    name: "John",
    ref: this
  };
}

let user8 = makeUser();

alert( user.ref.name ); // Error: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
</script>

<!-- because rules that set this do not look at object definition. Only the moment of call matters.

Here the value of this inside makeUser() is undefined, because it is called as a function, not as a method with “dot” syntax.

The value of this is one for the whole function, code blocks and object literals do not affect it. -->

<!-- So ref: this actually takes current this of the function.

We can rewrite the function and return the same this with undefined value: -->
<script>
function makeUser(){
  return this; // this time there's no object literal
}

alert( makeUser().name ); // Error: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
</script>


<!-- 
Create a calculator
Create an object calculator with three methods:

read() prompts for two values and saves them as object properties with names a and b respectively.
sum() returns the sum of saved values.
mul() multiplies saved values and returns the result.-->

<script>
let calculator = {
  // ... your code ...
};

calculator.read();
alert( calculator.sum() );
alert( calculator.mul() ); 

</script>

<!-- demo -->


<!-- Chaining
There’s a ladder object that allows you to go up and down: -->
<!-- <script>
let ladder = {
  step: 0,
  up() {
    this.step++;
  },
  down() {
    this.step--;
  },
  showStep: function() { // shows the current step
    alert( this.step );
  }
};
</script> -->

<!-- Now, if we need to make several calls in sequence, we can do it like this: -->
<script>
ladder.up();
ladder.up();
ladder.down();
ladder.showStep(); // 1
ladder.down();
ladder.showStep(); // 0
</script>

<!-- Modify the code of up, down, and showStep to make the calls chainable, like this: -->
<script>
ladder.up().up().down().showStep().down().showStep(); // shows 1 then 0
</script>
<!-- Such an approach is widely used across JavaScript libraries. -->


<!-- This is to return the object itself from every call. -->
<!-- solution -->
<script>
let ladder = {
  step: 0,
  up() {
    this.step++;
    return this;
  },
  down() {
    this.step--;
    return this;
  },
  showStep() {
    alert( this.step );
    return this;
  }
};

ladder.up().up().down().showStep().down().showStep(); // shows 1 then 0
</script>
<!-- Also can write a single call per line. For long chains it’s more readable: -->
<script>
ladder
  .up()
  .up()
  .down()
  .showStep() // 1
  .down()
  .showStep(); // 0
</script>
